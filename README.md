Hi, welcome to my profile!
I'm currently learning various programming techniques and languages, including back-end, front-end, and low-level computing. However, my goal is to focus on back-end technologies in the future.
I will be sharing small projects that I'm working on with some classmates.
I'm in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering.
Hope you enjoy my code! ðŸ˜Š
